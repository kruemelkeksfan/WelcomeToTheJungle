Weapons
	modifiable
		read dynamically
			OBJ
			Palette
			Particle System Positions and Attributes
			Weapon Stats
		Then assemble the Objects/Prefabs from this Data instead of pre-built Prefabs
		Same System for Equipment, Characters, Enemies, (player-built and Map-) Buildings, Maps
	Stocks foldable
		Reduces Storage Space
		Reduces Accuracy
		Increases Recoil
		Increases Accuracy after fast Turns/moving the Weapon
			give Accuracy Debuff for all Movement of the Gun in the last Second
				either make this 0.5 Seconds with Stock folded
				or reduce Debuff Intensity
	Weapon Sway
		Gun should move backwards on Recoil (nyi)
		Inertness to be implemented: guns adjust to new position slowly
		Random Sway as Shooter Skill Representation
		Accuracy is represented by already implemented random bullet deviation
Level System
	Skill/Perk System (tba)
	Chewing Gum
		Players can choose a Type of Chewing Gum that provides bonus Stats
		only 1 active at a Time
		maybe Drawbacks, but rather not
	Classes
		Engineer
			has Sandbags (and Aluminium Rods and Tent Fabric) which can be used to build Things
				Sandsack Walls/Emplacements
				Shelter Structure
		Radio Operator

Building System
	everybody has a Shovel to dig Trenches (uff Trenches?! And then you want Craters, too, I guess?!)
	People can outline their Blueprints/Plans, then Time will be sped up during Construction
	Time will be reset to normal if Enemy Fire happens
		explained by assigning a Guard during Construction, which would notice the Enemies and alert the builders
Quest System
	Quests with Purpose
	Dont give Tasks the Player would do anyways (e.g. "kill Enemies") or which are simply trivial/boring/time-consuming
	Possible Tasks
		Destroy Radar/Supply Depot/Radio Station
		Defend Point (see above: not boring or overly time-consuming, maybe think of cool Mechanics?)
		Attack Point
		Build Base (also needs some cool Mechanics to be fun a.k.a. actually a Reason to build a good Base)

Notes from Mac:

Singleplayer/Coop PvE Vietnam-War RPG
Skilltree inspired by Path of Exile, Level up after returning to base
Special Equipment Item: Bubble Gum, can have various effects: more accuracy, "bubble gum of the lucky bastard" (better thresholds on healthsystem)
Random generated Sectors with random Missions
after finishing or cancelling all missions of the sector can go to a neighbour sector on map or return to base
Map consists of different sectors
sectory types (different difficulty): patrol area (jungle), occupied village, FOB, Main Base
Can set up camp to heal, refill mags, clean weapons, etc.
Healthsystem hitbased, inspired by Running with rifles: 4 Thresholds: Nothing happens, Bleeding (Effect?), Down (only Coop-relevant), Death
chances worsen with every hit
random stats for guns
Enemies and frindlies guns are crap
good friendly guns from base trader
good enemy guns from bosses and weapon crates
